The purpose of this project is to create a basic binary tree as taught in data structure classes, but the implementation is a little bit too complicated for what it does.

The goal was to abstract everything and write code as if it was written in an object orianted language. This project was just a test for my programming skills back when I was a computer engineering student. too see how far can I abstract things and seperate different functionality as one would do in java for instance.
