The purpose of this project is to create a basic binary tree as taught in data structure classes, but the implementation is a little too complicated for what it does.

The goal was to abstract everything and write code as if it was written in an object orianted language. This project was just a test for my programming skills back when I was a computer engineering student. I wanted to see how far I can abstract things and seperate different functionalities as one would do in java for instance (writing C program in an object oriented fashion).
